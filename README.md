# Yumcha

A website to meet new people through yumcha, which is to have tea with them. Look for people around you who are having yumcha and join them or create your own yumcha and
wait for people to join you! This is a way to meet new people, network and have a good conversation while enjoying your meal!

**Check [Yumcha](https://yumcha.vercel.app/) to see the website on Vercel. Not all functions work.**

## Installation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

**For local installation**
1. Download all the files.
2. Use your own Google Maps API key or contact me. (since this is temporary)
3. Open up index.html for the **main page** or **map.html** for the map page.
4. You can also host this on a local server [localhost](http://localhost:3000).
